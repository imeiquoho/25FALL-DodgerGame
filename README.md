🕹️ 25FALL Dodger Game

Course: SODV2101 – Rapid Application Development
Institution: Bow Valley College
Term: Fall 2025
Assignment Type: Guided Learning Activity (GLA)
Student: Ime Iquoho

📌 Project Overview

The Dodger Game is a Windows Forms arcade-style game developed in C#.
The player controls a character and must avoid falling asteroids while surviving as long as possible.
The game demonstrates object-oriented programming, custom drawing, collision detection, and event-driven design using WinForms.

🎮 Gameplay Description

The player controls a movable object on the screen.

Asteroids are generated continuously and fall toward the player.

Collisions between the player and asteroids are detected.

When a collision occurs, the game ends.

Visual effects (such as explosions or animations) enhance gameplay feedback.

🧩 Key Features

Player movement logic

Asteroid generation and management

Collision detection

Custom graphics drawing

Game loop using timers

Object-oriented structure

Separation of responsibilities using multiple classes
